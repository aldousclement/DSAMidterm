# REACT JS

## WHAT IS REACT JS?

### KEY FEATURES OF REACT JS
1. Component-Based Architecture:

- React allows you to create UI elements as self-contained components. These components are independent, reusable, and can manage their own state, leading to a more modular and maintainable codebase.

2. Declarative Programming:

- With React, developers describe how the UI should look at any given time based on the app's state. React then handles the updates efficiently, making the development process more intuitive and predictable.

3. Virtual DOM:

- React uses a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. When a component's state changes, React first updates the Virtual DOM and then compares it with the real DOM. This reconciliation process minimizes the number of actual DOM manipulations, improving app performance.

4. Unidirectional Data Flow:

- React enforces one-way data binding, meaning data flows in a single direction, typically from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to understand how data changes and where the changes originate.

5. JSX (JavaScript XML):

- React employs JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to create and visualize the structure of the UI alongside the logic for handling user interactions.
 
6. State and Props:

- State represents mutable data specific to a component, and React automatically re-renders the component when its state changes.
Props are immutable data passed from a parent component to a child. They enable communication between components and are read-only.

7. Hooks:

- Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks allow functional components to manage state and side effects without needing class-based components. Popular hooks include useState for state management and useEffect for handling side effects like data fetching or subscribing to external services.

8. Ecosystem and Tools:

- React has a rich set of accompanying tools and libraries, including React Router for managing navigation and Redux for centralized state management. There’s also React Native, which extends React’s principles to mobile app development.
